            <h3>Website Planning</h3>
            <p class="answer">Trello has made it easy to break down the larger project of designing my website into smaller tasks such as site content and review. However since I’m accustomed to using other project management tools professionally in previous design projects, I found that the card model wasn’t initially intuitive and took conscious effort to break away from actually performing the tasks and remembering to update the board. It may be more helpful in a team environment.</p>
            <h3>Production</h3>
            <p class="answer">
            Visual Studio Code was more than fit for purpose in helping to achieve the creation of a (semi) functional website. For a start it supported all of the file types needed to build my website (eg. HTML, CSS) and intelligently drew my attention to any syntax errors. It also presented no cost or particular hardware/software challenges as it is free to download ca be used across browsers.
            </p>
            <h3>Deployment, Version Control and Collaboration</h3>
            <p class="answer">Git (version control software developed by Linux creator Linus Torvalds in 2005)[1] and GitHub (a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control, based on Git[2], now owned by Microsoft) were essential in ensuring that my site files could be viewed by the world, and didn’t remain locally hosted on my computer.</p>

            <p class="answer">A tutorial written by software company Atlassian (whose products include Trello) point to Git and Github’s clear advantages over competitor VCSs (Version Control Systems) - namely superior performance (Git can account for legacy software and platforms), security (the fact that Git is a Distributed Version Control System, which protects the repository from damage to one host machine) and flexibility (pull requests by different developers make production an adaptable, non-linear process)[1].</p>

            <p class="answer">In the particular instance of my website, I am now able to draw on a wider knowledge base than I possessed at the beginning of the project, and therefore I am keen to revisit issues such as those presented with the navigation bar by accessing earlier versions of the HTML pages/CSS stylesheet. Version control is particularly useful when bugs arise after testing, or if files are accidentally destroyed[3]. It would also be helpful to consider pull requests from other developers and commit them to my source code - because GitHub has become such an industry standard, it is likely to make the collaborative process even easier.</p>
