            <div class="question">1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
            </div>
    
            <p class="answer">
                Any number of factors could cause a digital project to fail - Bernard Marr writes in Forbes that as many as 25% fail outright, and attributes the failure of 54% of these to poor management over technological issues.[1]</p>

                <p class="answer">Namely, he blames having poorly defined (or no defined) outcome, a lack of leadership and accountability, insufficient communication between tech/non-tech stakeholders (an issue which team intermediaries such as Scrum Masters aim to resolve), no plan or timeline with progress markers, lack of real-world user testing/failure to address feedback and solving the wrong problem (such as reducing call duration in a call centre, which paradoxically results in lower customer satisfaction).</p>

                <p class="answer">Dr. Darrell R. Schrag writing for Devops.com also suggests that making critical applications, environments and infrastructures too complex increases their risk of failing at colossal cost, and that lack of consistency across the release pipeline is another contributing factor[2]. To counter this, he discusses “shifting left”, a key DevOps component where testing is conducted as early as possible in a product’s lifecycle to avoid costly bug fixes later[3], and ensuring a consistent production environment throughout by, for example, using cloud capabilities for simulation and continuous deployment.</p>

                <p class="answer">Other risks posed to digital projects could include scope creep, task dependencies, changes to production tools or technologies which mean that the deployed product can no longer run as intended, organisational change within a development team such as when a key member with exclusive knowledge or capabilities leaves, challenges from competitors, reduced project budget or organisational priorities due to global events, data loss and damage to physical assets such as a fire affecting hardware or network/infrastructure, cyber security attacks, or expensive changes to legal frameworks (such as GDPR) which affect the use of data.[4]</p>
