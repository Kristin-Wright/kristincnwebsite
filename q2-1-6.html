            <div class="question">1.6 Describe access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">The accessibility of websites has become increasingly more important as the rate of technological innovation has gathered pace - not least because of the challenges posed by ageing global populations, and the trend towards disability discrimination lawsuits in the USA. [1] Physical complications caused by the COVID-19 pandemic across all age groups will only accelerate the need for accessible web design, through which for example medical prescriptions can be managed. [2]</p>

            <p class="answer">Tim Berners-Lee - W3C Director and inventor of the World Wide Web - believes that “the power of the Web is in its universality”, with access regardless of disability playing a key part in a global digital consciousness. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities goes further in recognising access to information and communications technologies, including the Web, as a basic human right. [3, 4]</p>

            <p class="answer">For the less humanitarian, there is also a clear business case in resolving digital accessibility issues and making websites attractive to ‘purple pound’ (the spending power of disabled households) consumers: in the UK, around 73% of potential disabled customers experience barriers on more than a quarter of websites they visited, leading to an estimated £11.75 billion missed sales opportunity through online shoppers navigating away from inaccessible websites.[5]</p>

            <p class="answer">Furthermore, W3C also states that: “Accessibility overlaps with other best practices such as mobile web design, device independence, multi-modal interaction, usability, design for older users, and search engine optimization (SEO). Case studies show that accessible websites have better search results, reduced maintenance costs, and increased audience reach, among other benefits.”[3]</p>

            <p class="answer">According to the W3C, all users must be able to perceive, understand, navigate, interact and contribute to the Web should they wish. Accessibility issues that all users may face, regardless of whether they’re classified as disabled or not, when accessing websites can include auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech or visual.</p>

            <p class="answer">These disabilities may be permanent (such as lifelong disability due to a genetic condition or accident or changing abilities due to ageing), temporary (such as having a broken arm or losing glasses), situational disability (such as experiencing screen glare in bright sunlight or being unable to listen to audio accompanying a video in a noisy environment). Accessibility issues also affect people who, for any number of reasons including poverty, political unrest or being based in a remote location, have a slow internet connection, limited or expensive bandwidth or are using old devices or operating systems.[6]</p>

            <p class="answer">These factors might be addressed in web design through a wide range of measures set out by the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI). Some examples include adding descriptive alt-text labels and captions to non-text content such as images, logos or charts for visually-impaired users with text-to-speech screen readers or those in low bandwidth areas, consistent and labelled navigation for those with fine motor impediments, video transcripts and captions for those who are hard of hearing or on a crowded train, or sufficient colour contrast for colourblind users or those with cognitive difficulties.[7]</p>
