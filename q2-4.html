                <p class="answer">
                    Regarding design, with more time and technical expertise I would probably create a single page homepage with scrolling parallax effects and simple scroll animations. A social media presence is almost an essential requirement for all professionals, and so I would include linked buttons to my professional Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles. It would also have been great to include a coding ‘Easter Egg’ somewhere on the site to reward user engagement and retention, thereby creating a memorable digital experience.

                    Once completed, the site would probably benefit from some targeted user testing from potential hiring managers (creative directors/leads, design agency HR managers, recruitment agents) to see what questions they ask of themselves when searching for candidates to recruit - for example, “Where can I find examples of their work?”, “Do they have the necessary experience/skills to meet our requirements?” or even “Who is this person??”.

                <p class="answer">
                    This would then inform decisions around which CTA (“Call-to-action”) buttons to place on the homepage, which sections to make more prominent - such as the position of the ‘Coursework’ tab in the navigation bar, and how to optimise the site for SEO.

                    Further testing of mobile responsiveness and resolving other pain points my target audience encounter when using the site would also be an important part of the iterative agile process, as it would minimise frustration on behalf of the user and therefore the bounce rate. I also haven’t yet tested the site to see whether it complies with W3C accessibility standards, which is a critical issue to consider given the increasing importance of inclusive web design.

                <p class="answer">
                    I would also have resolved outstanding issues/bugs such as the addition of PHP to the contact form page in order to make it functional, and issues with the positioning of elements on each page (such as the display issues with the nav bar - the logo also needs to be replaced by a PNG with a transparent background).
