            <div class="question">1.7 Describe which are appropriate file types for websites.
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">A website’s structure itself is comprised of a number of different file types - HTML (eg. index.html) as its backbone, CSS (eg. main.css) for styling and JavaScript (eg. script.js) for interactivity. Depending on functionality requirements, other file types may also be uploaded via FTP (‘File Transfer Protocol’) and hosted on a website’s server, including Python (eg. example.py) and PHP (eg. example.php) files.</p>

            <p class="answer">In terms of content, a variety of images may be used on a website depending on specific requirements and restrictions. [1]</p>

            <p class="answer">JPEGs (‘Joint Photographic Experts Group’) graphics are historically the most common for raster (bitmap) images such as photos, however as they are a ‘lossy’ format they tend to lose quality with each successive alteration and when expanded beyond their original dimensions.</p>

            <p class="answer">Although they are also raster graphics, PNGs (Portable Network Graphics) use ‘lossless’ data compression and therefore tend to provide a crisper result - ideal for logos or text-based images. Additionally, PNGs allow for graphics on transparent backgrounds, whereas JPEGs must be saved on a white background by default.</p>

            <p class="answer">GIFs again are a lossless file type but are restricted to only 256 colours; simple stop-frame animations are often uploaded to a site in this format - for example, to illustrate a user interaction (such as performing a specific task) or to entertain and engage a site’s audience.</p>

            <p class="answer">In the era of responsive design, SVGs (Scalable Vector Graphics) are an even more accommodating option with regard to screen size and device choice as they resize automatically without a loss of quality.</p>

            <p class="answer">Additional content such as annual reports or briefing documents in PDF format, embedded .mp4, .mov and .wlv videos (if not hosted externally on sites such as YouTube), and audio files such as .mp3 and .wav files for podcasts etc. may also be hosted in order to enhance a site.</p>
