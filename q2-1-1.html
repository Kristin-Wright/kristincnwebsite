            <div><h2>Unit 2, Outcome 1</h2></div>
            <div class="question">1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page of your website.
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">A fixed nav bar is a common feature across each page - again, complying with Jakob Nielsen’s "<a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design</a>" to ensure that the user always has a conventional method of finding what they need, and an ‘escape route’ should they want it. The content is mostly text-based as I didn’t have time to insert the images and diagrams I wanted to include to illustrate certain approaches and methodologies. Where images are used, such as the logo in the nav bar and the profile picture on the homepage, alt tags have also been added to maximise accessibility for visitors using a screen reader.</p>

            <p class="answer">I recognise that the resulting several pages of copy/text should have been shorter in order to keep the content legible, however I found it difficult to describe some complex technical terms succinctly. Putting the answers to each question on a separate page and using H1, H2 etc. tags to create an information hierarchy helped to address this issue - with a little more time, however, I’d investigate accordion menus or similar devices to present the information in a more compact manner.</p>

            <p class="answer">A footer at the bottom of relevant pages holds links to sources referenced throughout the text on my website. The homepage contains images such as my logo (linked to the homepage), a stylised profile picture and a CTA - a button allowing direct access to the content visitors to my website are likely to want to see first.</p>
