            <div class="question">1.2 Describe methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?
    
                <p class="answer">
                    There are common established methodologies and frameworks within the tech industry (now being applied to other sectors due to their success) which can be used to ensure that a digital project meets and exceeds its objectives.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">The ‘Agile’ working methodology is an iterative approach to project management and software development that allows a team to iterate rapidly and deliver value in increments, or ‘user stories’ rather than in one big chunk at the end of the project (by which time the technologies and hardware/software for which it was being developed may be redundant).[1]</p>

                <p class="answer">The popular Kanban framework (on which project management tools such as Trello are based) complements this principle by allowing the team to break the tasks down into smaller components and to see the status of all tasks in real-time. Work items are moved to the right across a virtual board from a ‘To Do’ to ‘Doing’ to ‘Done’ list.[2]</p>

                <p class="answer">The Scrum framework builds on the Agile methodology and consists of highly defined roles, values, events/meetings (such as iterative sprints) and artefacts (such as the Product Backlog - an ordered list of required features that continues to be a dynamic, ‘living’ document even after deployment of the product).</p>

                <p class="answer">The Scrum approach encourages collaboration across all stakeholders in the project, self-organisation and continuous review and improvement. Teams and the ‘product owner’ (client) jointly agree on a ‘definition of DONE’ (DoD) - a list of criteria which need to be met at the end of a product increment in order to consider it complete.[3, 4] Some, particularly developers, consider Scrum’s rigid framework to be in direct opposition to Agile’s four core values, including “individuals and interactions over processes and tools”, and discourages adaptability and innovation.[5, 6]</p>

                <p class="answer">Outside of established tech frameworks and technologies, the usual transferable skills are required to make a project: effective leadership, independent planning and time management, accountability, teamwork/collaboration, resilience and tenacity to find solutions to technical issues through testing, adaptability, and continuous awareness of innovation in the wider digital sphere.</p>

                <p class="answer">Tools and resources could include adequate, updated hardware/software, robust network infrastructure and a team of developers with the required programming skillsets.</p>
