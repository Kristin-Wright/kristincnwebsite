            <div class="question">3.3 Develop solutions to improve your own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">Ideally I would have taken more time ahead of working on the project to follow tutorials/read documentation on the different project tools (eg. Slack, Trello), as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Knowing what was possible with these languages would have better informed the design and build of the site.</p>

            <p class="answer">With more time and an enhanced personal skillset, I would have included a slideshow (perhaps to showcase portfolio case studies), included simple animations and user interactions, or designed the site as a single page scrolling experience or as a presentation.</p>

            <p class="answer">Working on this project as a team may have meant that I could have focussed more on a specific area such as design, rather than research of the written content or planning through Trello. However I would have possibly had to contend with Zoom calls timing out, or difference in creative opinion.</p>
