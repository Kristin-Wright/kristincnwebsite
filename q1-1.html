            <div class="question">1.1 Describe the purpose of IT in modern business.
    
                <p class="answer">
                    Some would argue that no business could survive in today’s world without IT (Information Technology). So much so that Patrick Fisher (Global Business Director of Technology Practice Group, writing for Thomson Reuters) suggests that “all companies are technology companies now”, forcing more traditional industries to adopt new technologies to maintain a competitive edge and exceed efficiency standards.

                <p class="answer">
                    He puts this down to three key factors: the demands posed by constant global interconnectedness, the pervasiveness of the “IoT” (“Internet of Things”) and the urgent need for collaborative innovation across geographic locations and timezones [1].

                <p class="answer">
                    Daniel Newman, Principal Analyst of Futurum Research and CEO of Broadsuite Media Group, also writes in Forbes that instead of being designated to a separate “lone geek pack” within a company, IT is driving change at an organisational level, leading individual departments to operate as smaller, connected, agile teams in order to respond rapidly to modern challenges [2].

                <p class="answer">
                    Given the indisputable importance of IT within an organisation, its purpose has been amplified across a number of broad functions, including Accounting & Finance (eg. payroll and financial forecasting/data analysis), Operations & Logistics (eg. eCommerce fulfillment), Human Resources (eg. eLearning), Customer Service (eg. call centre management) and Marketing & Sales (eg. promotional materials). In my opinion though, IT is particularly indispensable in addressing communication, project management and data security as they affect all departments regardless of their specific IT requirements.

                <p class="answer">
                    Communications & Project Management: VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) tools such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams, team communication platforms such as Slack and collaborative project management tools such as Kanban-based Trello allow stakeholders at all levels to hold business-critical conversations.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    These include everything from internal team stand-ups, reviewing of documents between departments (such as Legal making amends to Terms and Conditions PDFs in collaboration with the Digital team to upload to the intranet or client-facing company website), to new business pitches delivered by the Sales team or communications between the CEO and investors. Increased communication via these digital means greatly promotes cohesion within an organisation, and prevents ‘silos’ of knowledge within teams which leaves the company vulnerable to disruption if one of these silos collapses [3].
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    Due to the coronavirus pandemic and the need to physically socially distance, IT has helped HR to conduct Zoom interviews, and sadly are also announcing mass redundancies over these meetings or via email. An unnerving development has also seen employers in the US insist on the installation of employee surveillance software such as HubStaff or TSheets to ensure that workers are engaged during business hours while working from home, although this has to be deemed to be transparent and justifiable in the UK. [4, 5]

                <p class="answer">
                    Cloud-based hosting and collaborative version control sites such as Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive (possibly integrated with Slack) and GitHub can also further increase team efficiency by reducing the amount of time members take to find a given resource and assisting communication.

                <p class="answer">
                    Data Security: The Data Protection Act has been around in the UK since 1998, setting out businesses’ obligations to protect customer data and collect/process it responsibly. This has further been compounded by the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in 2018. However according to BBC News’ report on insurance company Hiscox’s findings in April 2019, over half of businesses had experienced a cyber attack - resulting in an average loss of £284,042 ($369,000).[6] IT in this case would be critical in ensuring that businesses comply with their legal obligations through appropriate security software and processes including encryption of CRM databases and user permission access levels.
