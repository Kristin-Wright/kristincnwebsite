            <p class="answer">
                Good planning is a key component of a digital project’s success[1]. In the case of my website, I used the kanban project management method underpinning Trello to break down the larger project into smaller tasks on virtual ‘cards’. Colour-coded labels helped to distinguish tasks related to the site’s planning, content (namely the written answers to these questions, images and linked files), build in HTML/CSS and review/testing.</p>

                <p class="answer">These were then moved across the board from the ‘To Do’ list, to ‘Doing’ and ‘Done’ to reflect the status of each task; I also added a ‘Nice To Have’ features list/product backlog to address should I have time to do so in future.</p>

                <p class="answer">A quick homepage layout (originally intended as a site map) in Diagrams.net helped to visualise the site structure and pages needed; given time, I would also have created wireframes and perhaps a working prototype in a tool such as Adobe XD as I need to visualise the end design before jumping straight into building and coding through trial and error.</p>
