        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I’m Kristin - a graphic designer currently based in Bristol, UK. I was born in São Paulo, Brazil, to an Argentinian mum and English dad, and spent 16 years growing up in Portugal and Spain. It’s probably no surprise then that I love languages, from Spanish and Portuguese to JavaScript and Python!</p>

        <div id="design-services">

            <h2>The Journey to Code Nation</h2>

            <p>Although I’ve always been fascinated by technology and interactive design, my previous coding experience was fairly tentative. I’d dabbled with self-taught HTML, CSS and JavaScript lessons through Codecademy, W3Schools and the odd evening class, tinkered with WordPress, attended conferences such as Microsoft Build and Brighton SEO, and even used a little HTML professionally on content, category and product pages for The Body Shop International’s ecommerce site - based on a stubbornly design-resistant CMS (content management system).
            </p>

            <p>I loved how digital media suddenly made it possible to see which designs worked and which didn’t by examining visitor traffic, clickthroughs and other Google Analytics data; with print, I found that the final artwork was packaged up and dispatched into the ether, with very little feedback on how well it was received (or otherwise)...
            </p>

            <p>I’d known for a long time that I needed to focus on elevating my skillset to the digital standard demanded by industry, so when the pandemic struck and a Facebook advert for Codenation popped into my timeline, I knew that this would be the perfect opportunity.
            </p>

            <p>So far I’m thrilled to have been back in a class environment with a group of passionate junior devs. Having to meet up remotely over Zoom due to current social distancing regulations so far really hasn’t been a barrier to learning - in fact, not having to stress over travel has been amazing! The course is well-structured and has managed to pack a tonne into a short three week period. It’s also made me realise how much there is still left to learn...
