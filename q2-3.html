                    Overall, I’m not at all satisfied with the outcome of this website - I feel that as it stands, it wouldn’t achieve my primary objective of showcasing the level of skill required from a prospective Technical Consultant by the clients or companies I would like to work with. It only takes a quick look at <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">awwwards.com</a> to see that the bar is raised fairly high!

                <p class="answer">
                    Due to current skill limitations and time restraints, I’ve had to compromise on a few design features and testing as it would have taken too long to research solutions online, and skip the UX/UI planning process - which I believe is a crucial step in my personal workflow.

                <p class="answer">
                    Given the opportunity, there are several improvements I could make around site features, user experience and interface design (UX/UI) especially with regard to accessibility, responsiveness and testing.
