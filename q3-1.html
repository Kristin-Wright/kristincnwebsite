            <div><h2>Unit 1, Outcome 3</h2></div>
            <div class="question">3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">Upon review, I think this project fell down in the initial planning stage and in taking too long to write the content due to extenuating circumstances outside of the course.</p>

            <p class="answer">Given the chance to tackle this coursework again on a longer timescale, I would have perhaps spent a little longer drawing up a user flow diagram and site map, researching user interface (UI) conventions and visualising interactions between the different sections of the website with a wireframe prototype.</p>

            <p class="answer">I would also perhaps have adopted a more focussed approach to research in order to get the written content together quicker, and organised all content formats into a Google Sheets document to have a general overview - useful on a larger project with assets supplied by a variety of sources.</p>

            <p class="answer">Trello could also have been useful in this respect within a larger organisation to track which assets were still outstanding (for example, an amended PDF form from the Human Resources department, or updated brand assets from Marketing).</p>

            <p class="answer">Dividing up the task within a team would also have been hugely helpful in getting the project over the line - someone could have been tasked with the planning elements, another with project management and communication with other stakeholders via Slack, another could have applied template code to any new pages or uploaded assets via GitHub. More would have been possible within the timeframe, and the project would have benefited from experience and expertise in a diverse range of capabilities.</p>

            <p class="answer">This would, however, potentially have created task dependencies - where one task (the predecessor) may be affected by another (the successor). This may have meant that any delays in completion of any planning tasks, for example, would have adversely affected the production phase.[1]</p>

            <p class="answer"></p>It would have also helped to have had another computer on which to run Zoom, and more processor/intensive tools to prevent lag when switching between programmes or running a RAM-hungry browser.</p>
