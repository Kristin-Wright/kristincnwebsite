            <div class="question">3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency.
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">As before, I would have adopted a more focussed approach to executing tasks and employed better strategies to manage my ADHD in order to improve time management.</p>

            <p class="answer">Unfortunately further extenuating circumstances around a death had affected my ability to concentrate fully on completing outstanding tasks. Although I agree that this should not have affected the work required to meet the qualification criteria, it unfortunately did nonetheless. I’m not sure how I would improve on this in future to mitigate its impact, other than to hope that it doesn’t happen again.</p>

            <p class="answer">Being strict on screen breaks and trying to achieve tasks within the working day has been helpful in avoiding burnout, and thereby maintaining productivity to some degree. However I did notice that I began falling behind other classmates who worked through their breaks and put in additional time after class - perhaps this is unavoidable in meeting set goals which require a certain commitment of time and energy.</p>

            <p class="answer">In terms of personal productivity, I also found it useful to be in a comfortable working environment at home, where I haven’t had to queue for lunch/shared facilities or waste time and energy on a commute. I did initially struggle a little with my second screen plus Bluetooth wireless keyboard setup since I kept losing windows between the two screens, and the Bluetooth keyboard kept having to be activated before typing - which led to a few minor coding errors. A better home office set up with a more ergonomic chair and desk would also have helped to improve productivity and efficiency.</p>
