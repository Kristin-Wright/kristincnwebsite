            <div><h2>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h2></div>
            <div class="question">2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? e.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.
            </div>
        
            <div>
            
                <p class="answer">I’m generally happy with all the chosen tools used in this project as they were all fit for purpose, being accessible both from a cost point of view and being well-supported through documentation or online tutorials.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Visual Studio Code (Production IDE/Integrated Development Environment/Text Editor)</h3>
                <p class="answer">
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    Easy to code in several different programming languages without having to change tool or software. Intellisense syntax highlighting - easy to see where bugs were before running code.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong>
                    Not a WYSIWIG (‘What You See Is What You Get’) editor like Dreamweaver - had to refer to a browser window to view the updated design (although using a split screen with VS Code achieves the same effect, as does using developer tools within Chrome or Firefox themselves to edit eg. CSS style sheets).
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    <h3>Trello (Kanban project management tool)</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    Useful to visualise tasks and break project down into smaller chunks. Becoming more intuitive to use, categorise tasks by label and assign due dates.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong>
                    Can get a little messy and overwhelming without “folders” to conceal irrelevant cards (perhaps the list feature was designed to categorise items instead?). A calendar feature would be better on a longer project to be able to visualise due dates (this may already exist, but I haven’t found it yet! Will have to search Trello documentation/other online resources).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="answer">
                    <h3>Draw.io/Diagrams.net (information architecture/user experience/sitemap drawing tool)</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    I had used the online tool in a previous project, so it was intuitive to use in visualising my website’s navigation structure.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong>
                    It has been tricky to visualise some elements/user interactions like button/menu hover effects, though I’m sure there is a conventional method of doing so - I’ll have to research further. Some elements have had to be revisited due to the limitations of my HTML/CSS coding abilities, and therefore haven’t been reflected in the sitemap.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    <h3>Google Drive (cloud storage/sharing app)</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    Easy to amass written content for the website in one document rather than amend the copy/text in the HTML code afterwards. I was also able to share a link with our tutor and set his access permissions to allow him to comment within the document if he wanted to - a feature which would make it quick and easy for teams/different departments within an organisation (such as Legal, Finance and Marketing) to collaborate on online literature.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong>
                    I have had to remember to set correct access permissions before sharing the link, otherwise the other person won’t be able to view/comment on the document.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    <h3>Slack (team communication tool)</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    A good way to share useful web design resources such as CSS tutorial sites or code snippets between students and with the tutor.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong>
                    Constant notifications can be a little distracting, though it is possible to temporarily mute them.
                </p>

                <p class="answer">
                    <h3>Zoom (video communication tool)</h3>
                    <p class="answer">
                    <strong>Pros:</strong>
                    Zoom is almost dominating the VoIP industry and has become a standard, so all team members are likely to know how to use the tool. It also makes it easy to demonstrate thinking by sharing a computer screen (or for example, to resolve code bugs).


                    <br>
                    <strong>Cons:</strong>
                    Requires a paid subscription to hold continuous meetings without the call timing out; WiFi or hardware/software issues occasionally disrupt important communication and take time away from the project.
