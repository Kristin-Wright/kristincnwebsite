            <div class="question">1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?
            </div>
    
            <p class="answer">
            There are many methods and criteria which I, or an organisation or team, could use to evaluate IT and software for any given project. Most start by working with all stakeholders to consolidate a list of weighted “key technical capabilities that provide value to the end users, administrators and management”[1].</p>

            <p class="answer">Solutions Architect Andrej Suschevich writes in Medium that the main criteria to consider are <strong>project requirements and features</strong> (eg. project size - is the end result a single page website or ecommerce marketplace?), <strong>resources and experience</strong> (use tools that are intuitive to use, and find the middle ground between trusted yet slightly outdated technologies and newer contenders with fewer experts), <strong>scalability</strong> with increased user numbers, <strong>maintainability</strong>, <strong>security</strong> (eg. user permissions, online payments), and <strong>development speed</strong> (does an ‘off-the-shelf’ option need to be used due to short deployment time, or should it be a more custom solution?).[2]</p>

            <p class="answer">Cost is also an important factor, though seemingly low or no cost options such as open source should be treated with caution due to the hidden costs of maintenance and training, and poor documentation.[1]</p>

            <p class="answer">Once these have been considered, a team should use these to agree on their “tech stack” - a collection of both client-side and server-side programming languages, frameworks, libraries, development tools and programming approaches. This should be as concise as possible, and include tools only strictly necessary to completing the project.</p>

            <p class="answer">Several established ready-made tech stacks exist to make the decision-making process easier, such as the industry-standard LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP/Perl/Python), MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular.js and Node.js), MERN (MongoDB, Express, React.js and Node.js) and MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue.js and Node.js).</p>
