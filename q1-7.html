            <div class="question">1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – how does GDPR impact digital projects?
            </div>

            <p class="answer">Digital projects face a number of legal constraints in the course of their execution, such as issues around intellectual property (IP) enforcement, licensing, copyright or regulation governing a digital product features accessibility.</p>

            <p class="answer">One of the most significant recent legal constraints to be imposed is the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect on the 25th May 2018 in response to growing concerns over digital companies’ use (or misuse) of their consumers’ personal data.</p>

            <p class="answer">In 2011, for example, Google were successfully sued by one of their users for scanning her emails.[1] Since the imposition of harsh fines of €20 million or 4% of global revenue under GDPR, the tech giant were penalised again in 2019 by the French government for failing to disclose to users how their data was passed to the company’s advertising partners.[2, 3]</p>

            <p class="answer">GDPR essentially impacts on digital projects as all stakeholders including third party suppliers have to demonstrate that they are GDPR compliant (for example, by ensuring adequate collection,security, storage and processing of user data only for stated purposes, maintaining detailed documentation, appointing a Data Protection Officer (DPO) or providing staff with adequate training).[1]</p>

            <p class="answer">In terms of digital communications, the introduction of GDPR has meant that websites need to display notices explicitly and unambiguously obtaining consent from their users to store cookies on their computers, and mailing list subscribers now need to proactively opt into messages instead of being added by default.</p>
