            <div class="question">1.5 Describe copyright and other constraints affecting websites.
            </div>

            <div>

            <p class="answer">Copyright law, under the broader remit of Intellectual Property (IP) legislation, is a legal framework that seeks to protect the use (eg. copying, distribution or adaptation) of literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works.[1] In the UK, this is enshrined in the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988; abroad, work could be protected by copyright in other countries through international agreements, for example the <a href="http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/treaties/text.jsp?file_id=283693">Berne Convention</a>. Copyright generally lasts for a minimum of life plus 50 years (text) or 25 years (images) and is assigned automatically to the creator(s) of a work without further need to obtain legal validation.[2]</p>

            <p class="answer">Copyright in terms of websites can be fairly complex as they can be protected by copyright relating to both their content and structure. Their content can fall under any of the defined categories: artistic (eg. images, logos), literary (eg. blog posts, articles), dramatic (eg. videos, animations) or musical (eg. audio tracks).[3] The structure or coding behind websites is generally thought of as an extension to the literary category, though technological works are also specifically protected under the Copyright (Computer Programs) Regulations of 1992 along with other digital entities such as apps, spreadsheets and databases.[4]</p>

            <p class="answer">When designing websites, due care should be given to ensuring that all content (such as fonts, logos, artworks and written articles) are properly licensed for use and correctly attributed. While snippets of code can be copied to avoid recreating common features or CSS design devices, it could constitute copyright infringement to copy whole pages of source code.[5]</p>
